## Object Localization with RFID Technology in three-Dimensional Space using Drone and a Handheld RFID Reader


#Abstract

This Thesis focuses on locating objects in three-dimensional space upon which are placed passive RFID tags , with the use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (drone) and a handheld RFID reader (for smaller-scale applications) that carry the necessary RFID equipment . The basics of RFID technology is the RFID reader and the RFID tag . The reader emits an electromagnetic wave in a UHF frequency and receives the backscattered modulated EM-wave from each tag in range . The key elements of a tag include a circuit for the conversion of EM wave to DC (rectifier) , a transistor and an antenna. In the context of this thesis , was studied and experimentally confirmed a method of tracking passive UHF RFID tags called Fingerprinting - 3D Landmarc . This method in order to calculate the position of objects in 3D space is based on comparing the backscattered power of unknown tags with reference tags placed in known locations . This method was considered more appropriate than the others for use in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and handheld RFID reader because it does not depend on the position measures taken , but only on the positions of the reference tags . The method can be used both indoors and outdoors , in indoor experiments the error of the estimated position of objects is usually less than 35 cm with the handheld RFID reader while outdoors using the drone the error of the estimated position is less than 50 cm .
